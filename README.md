Rhythm game simulator

This is a hackathon project attempting to create a game for simulating rhythm games.
It can be used for example for learning how to play an instrument, by connecting an instrument to a computer via USB and interfacing the input.

The amount of "lanes" and the mapping from buttons to lanes are highly adjustable and easy to configure.

It requires the Slick2D libraries to compile and run.

It is still very, very incomplete, and has only very basic gameplay in place.
